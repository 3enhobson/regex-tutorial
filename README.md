# regex-tutorial

## Description

This assignment was to create a web-development tutorial based on the topic of regex, or regular expressions. It was assigned to give me the opportunity to show that asside from coding, I am able to explain a topic in a manor that is digestible for someone new to web development to easily understand. I decided to select a regex that explained how to identify a phone number. I chose this becasue I felt that it was structured in a way that would be approachable for someone with little experience on this subject. Creating this tutorial helped me understand the components of a regex and how they work. You can make them pretty simple or very complex depending on what you are looking for.
